<p>Anyone can help by suggesting new translations <a href="http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/meta-box/">here</a>. No need to use a Translation Editor, you can do it all from <a href="http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/meta-box/">GlotPress</a>!</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve suggested a new translation, a GlotPress validator will review it. They will then approve, reject, or change your suggestions. Once your changes get approved, they are automatically included in the next Meta Box release.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-glotpress-work-">How does GlotPress work?</h2>
<p>You can find detailed GlotPress documentation on <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/glotpress/">this page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="who-decides-which-languages-are-available-i-want-my-language-added">Who decides which languages are available? I want my language added</h2>
<p>If you can&#39;t find your language in GlotPress, <a href="https://metabox.io">send us an email</a> and we&#39;ll add it for you.</p>
<p>== I want to change translations locally. Where can I download the .PO file for my language? ==</p>
<p>You&#39;ll find options to create a .PO file and export translations at the bottom of each language page in GlotPress.</p>
